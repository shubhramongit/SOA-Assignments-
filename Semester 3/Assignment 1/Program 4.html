Cuttack, the largest city in Odisha, India, brims with a history stretching over a millennium. Nestled between the Kathajodi and Mahanadi Rivers, it bears the ancient name Kataka, or "The Fort," echoing its origins around the imposing Barabati Fort. This 14th-century fort, along with the Qadam-I-Rasool Mosque and the Netaji Birthplace Museum, lends the city an air of historical grandeur.

Culturally, Cuttack thrives as Odisha's cultural capital. It's famous for its grand Durga Puja celebrations, where the city's vibrant spirit truly shines. The intricate silver filigree work, or "Tarakashi," showcases the exceptional skill of its artisans, creating stunning pieces that blend traditional artistry with modern elegance.

The culinary scene in Cuttack is equally diverse and flavorful. Dahibara Aloodum, a street food favorite, combines lentil dumplings with spicy potato curry and yogurt. For those with a sweet tooth, Chhena Poda, a baked cheese dessert, offers a delightful taste of local flavors.

Functioning as the commercial and judicial hub of Odisha, Cuttack forms a dynamic urban landscape alongside its twin city, Bhubaneswar. The city's unplanned charm is evident in its labyrinth of streets and bustling bazaars, creating a unique urban tapestry.

Cuttack's resilience, cultural richness, and culinary delights make it a city that tells a thousand stories, inviting every visitor to be a part of its ongoing narrative.
