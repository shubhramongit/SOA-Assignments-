    <h1>ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
    Hello! My name is Shubhramjeet Sahoo, and I come from the lively city of Cuttack, Odisha. Growing up in such a culturally rich place has shaped my interests and passions. I love reading, especially historical fiction and biographies, as they allow me to explore different times and lives. Music is another passion of mine; I play the guitar and enjoy composing my own tunes, finding it a wonderful way to express myself.

Academically, I am pursing Engineering, which has given me a strong foundation and a thirst for knowledge. 

On a personal level, I believe in the power of positivity and kindness. I strive to maintain a positive attitude and enjoy helping others. In my free time, I love exploring new places, trying different cuisines, and spending quality time with family and friends. These activities keep me grounded and motivated.
