        Kashmir is a region located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, known for its stunning natural beauty, including lush green valleys, snow-capped mountains, and pristine lakes. Often referred to as "Paradise on Earth," it features iconic landscapes like Dal Lake, famous for its houseboats and shikaras (traditional wooden boats), and the picturesque gardens of Mughal architecture.

        Culturally rich, Kashmir has a diverse heritage influenced by various religions and traditions. The region is known for its handicrafts, such as pashmina shawls and intricate carpets. Despite its beauty, Kashmir has a complex history and is often associated with political tensions, especially between India and Pakistan.
