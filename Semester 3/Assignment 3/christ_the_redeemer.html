    <h1>Christ the Redeemer</h1>
    <p style="color: lavender;">
        Christ the Redeemer, towering over Rio de Janeiro from the peak of the Corcovado Mountain, is one of the most iconic statues in the world. Standing at 98 feet tall, with outstretched arms spanning 92 feet, this colossal representation of Jesus Christ was completed in 1931. Crafted from reinforced concrete and soapstone, it symbolizes peace and openness, embracing the entire city below. The statue not only represents a religious symbol for millions but also stands as a cultural icon of Brazil, reflecting the spirit of its people. With panoramic views of Rio's beaches, mountains, and cityscape, visiting Christ the Redeemer is an awe-inspiring experience that captures the beauty and vibrancy of Brazil.
