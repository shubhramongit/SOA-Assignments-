    <h2 id="1">BLACKBERRIES</h2>
    <img src="blackberry.webp" alt="blackberries">
    <p>
        The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus Rubus in the family Rosaceae, hybrids
        among these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The
        taxonomy of blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis, so that species
        have often been grouped together and called species aggregates.

        Blackberry fruit production is abundant with annual volumes of 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) per 1 acre (0.40 ha)
        possible, making this plant commercially attractive

        Blueberry is a widely distributed and widespread group of perennial flowering plants with blue or purple
        berries. They are classified in the section Cyanococcus within the genus Vaccinium.[1] Commercial
        blueberries—both wild (lowbush) and cultivated (highbush)—are all native to North America. The highbush
        varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.[2]

        Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (4 inches) to 4 meters (13
        feet) in height. In commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea-size berries growing on
        low-level bushes are known as "lowbush blueberries" (synonymous with "wild"), while the species with larger
        berries growing on taller, cultivated bushes are known as "highbush blueberries". Canada is the leading producer
        of lowbush blueberries, while the United States produces some 40% of the world's supply of highbush blueberries

    <h2 id="3">HUCKLEBERRIES</h2>
    <img src="huckleberry.jpg" alt="Huckleberries">
    <p>
        The name 'huckleberry' is a North American variation of the English dialectal name variously called
        'hurtleberry' or 'whortleberry' (/ˈhwɜːrtəlbɛri/) for the bilberry.[1] In North America, the name was applied to
        numerous plant variations, all bearing small berries with colors that may be red, blue, or black.[2] It is the
        common name for various Gaylussacia species, and some Vaccinium species, such as Vaccinium parvifolium, the red
        huckleberry, and is also applied to other Vaccinium species which may also be called blueberries depending upon
        local custom, as in New England and parts of Appalachia.[2]

    <h2 id="4">LOGANBERRIES</h2>
    <img src="loganberry.webp" alt="Loganberries">
    <p>
        The loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) is a hybrid of the North American blackberry (Rubus ursinus) and the
        European raspberry (Rubus idaeus),[1][2] accidentally bred in 1881 by James Harvey Logan, for whom they are
        named.[3] They are cultivated for their edible fruit

    <h2 id="5">RASBERRIES</h2>
    <img src="raspberry.jpg" alt="raspberries">
    <p>
        The raspberry is the edible fruit of several plant species in the genus Rubus of the rose family, most of which
        are in the subgenus Idaeobatus.[1] The name also applies to these plants themselves. Raspberries are perennial
        with woody stems.[2]

        World production of raspberries in 2022 was 947,852 tonnes, led by Russia with 22% of the total. Raspberries are
        cultivated across northern Europe and North America and are consumed in various ways, including as whole fruit
        and in preserves, cakes, ice cream, and liqueurs.[3] Raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C, manganese, and
        dietary fiber.

    <h2 id="6">STRAWBERRIES</h2>
    <img src="Strawberry.jpg" alt="strawberries">
    <p>
        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria in the rose family, Rosaceae, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as confectionery, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.

        The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century
