    <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
    <p style="color: lavender;">Machu Picchu, nestled high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, is a testament to the ingenuity and architectural brilliance of the Inca civilization. Discovered in 1911 by American historian Hiram Bingham, this 15th-century citadel remained hidden from the world for centuries. Perched at an altitude of 7,970 feet, Machu Picchu showcases the Incas' mastery in building with stone, seamlessly integrating with the natural landscape. The site consists of terraced fields, residential areas, temples, and astronomical observatories, reflecting a sophisticated society deeply connected to its environment. Surrounded by lush, green peaks and often shrouded in mist, Machu Picchu remains a symbol of mystery, ancient history, and breathtaking beauty, attracting millions of visitors who seek to experience its timeless charm.
