    <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
    <p style="color:lavender;">The Great Wall of China stands as a monumental feat of ancient engineering and human perseverance. Stretching over 13,000 miles, it was initially constructed to protect Chinese states and empires from invasions by nomadic tribes and military incursions. Built primarily between the 7th and 16th centuries, the wall traverses mountains, deserts, and plains, showcasing the incredible range of landscapes within China. Beyond its defensive purposes, the Great Wall also served as a means of controlling immigration and emigration, as well as facilitating trade along the Silk Road. Today, it remains a symbol of China's enduring strength and architectural ingenuity, drawing millions of visitors each year who come to marvel at its sheer scale and historical significance.
